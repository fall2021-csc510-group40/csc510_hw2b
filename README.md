Welcome to the repository for the Homework 2b submission by CSC 510 f21 Group 40.

This repository is intended to show some of the best practices when setting up an organized repository, such as:
* Continuous integration testing (using Travis CI)
* Creation of a License for the repository
* Inclusion of files such as a .gitignore, CITATION.md, and CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md
* Badges to learn a variety of information about the repository at-a-glance
* Verbose README files (such as this!)
